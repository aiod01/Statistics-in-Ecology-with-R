# STAT506H

## Data description

You can find the salinity and temperature data in the salinity_temperature.csv file for each site (A, B, C, D, and E) and each subsite within site (beach, raft).

Shell length/weight and tissue weight data are separate for each time point that data were collected. The initial measurements of oysters made before the outplant began were made for 50 individual oysters. Their shell length/weight and tissue weight are in the growth_data_zero.csv file.
Data were collected every two months from March 2017 to November 2017, and then were not collected again until March 2018 since growth is minimal over the wintertime. Some oyster bags were lost during the year (e.g. subsite C raft in spring 2017, subsite B raft, which lost three bags between November 2017 - March 2018).

Mortality data are in the mort_data.csv file.
